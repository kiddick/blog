#### Blog

Yeah! Another blog reincarnation in 2017 :D
I've tried several static site generators. That was useful experience with Pelican and Lector. But that looks like overkill solution. And there were a lot of distracting factors from writing blog posts. Messing with configuration and style. Edge cases with unstable versions of Lektor and lack of documentation. So there is another attempt from scratch. I'll start with plain text in markdown. Not sure about stuff organization for a while. Yeah with markdown some opportunities are cutted down such as proper images handling and custom html parts. But lets try that approach without redundant stuff. 

I am thinking about global newsletter. There will be a bunch of different updates and notes will be split by timestamps.
